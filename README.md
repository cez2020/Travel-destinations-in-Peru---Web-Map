# CREATE A LEAFLET MAP USING YOUR OWN GEOJSON FILES
Let's build a Web Map.
Travel destinations in Peru were used for this project, but any other geographic data can be easily implemented.

## Requires

* GEOJSON files - can be downloaded from external sources or converted from shapefiles using a free software like QGIS
* For this webmap, GEOJSON files are included within the script.JS file
* A Mapbox API - it's FREE
* Leaflet library 1.7.1 (called in script file)
* Mapshakers/leaflet-control-window - Leaflet plug-in that facilitates modal popups
